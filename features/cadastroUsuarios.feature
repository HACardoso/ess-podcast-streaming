		# Given the system has no user with username "user01"
		# And the system has no email "user@mail.com"

		# Then the username "user01" is properly stored in the system
		# And I see a confirmation that my account is created
		# And i am redirected to the personal information page


		Given I am at the "Login Page"

		*   	I fill the email field with "user@email.com" that is contained at the system
    *     I fill the password with "R1CbsKa2", which satisfies the passwords conditions
    *     I set the birthday to "13/02/1998", where I am over 18 years 
    And   thus not needing an responsible account
